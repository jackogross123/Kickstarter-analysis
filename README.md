## An Analysis of a dataset of Kickstarter Fundraising Efforts.
### The purpose 
The purpose of the anaylsis was to determine how different factors contributed to the outcome of the fundraising campaign. The four different outcomes of the campaign were successful, failed, cancelled, and live.
## Two Different Analyses 
Louise wanted to know how fundraiser launch date and goal impacted the outcome of the the fundraising campaign. Louise wants to take this information and apply it to her own play, *Fever.*
