# Kickstarting with Excel
## An Analysis of a dataset of Kickstarter Fundraising Efforts.
### The purpose 
The purpose of the anaylsis was to determine how different factors contributed to the outcome of the fundraising campaign. The four different outcomes of the campaign were successful, failed, cancelled, and live.
## Two Different Analyses 
Louise wanted to know how **fundraiser launch date** and **fundraiser goal** impacted the outcome of the the fundraising campaign. Louise wants to take this information and apply it to her own play, *Fever.*
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The purpose of this analyis was to determine if the launch month of Theater fundraising campaigns has any impact on the outcome of the campaign. 

To perform this analysis I created a pivot table of the entire Kickstarter data sheet. In the fields, I filtered by Parent Category and Years, added outcomes to the columns, added Months to the rows (Months is a column that I made on the kickstarter sheet to better visualize the data), and added Count of outcomes to the values field.
